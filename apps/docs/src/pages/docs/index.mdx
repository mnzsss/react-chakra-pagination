# Nextra

**Nextra** is a framework on top of Next.js, that lets you build content focused
websites. It has all the great features from Next.js, plus extra power to create
Markdown-based content with ease.

## Quick Start

import { Card, Cards } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

To start using Nextra, you need to select a theme first:

<Cards num={2}>
  <Card image arrow title="Documentation theme" href="/docs/docs-theme/start">
    <>![Documentation theme](/assets/docs-theme.png)</>
  </Card>
  <Card image arrow title="Blog theme" href="/docs/blog-theme/start">
    <>![Blog theme](/assets/blog-theme.png)</>
  </Card>
</Cards>

If you want to use Nextra without a preset theme, or build your own theme, you
can follow the [Custom Theme](/docs/custom-theme) docs.
